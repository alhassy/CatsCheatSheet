  STT has to kinds of syntactic objects.
    - /Expressions/ denote values including truth values ~true~ and ~false~;
      they do what both terms and formulae do in first-order logic.
    - /Types/ denote nonempty sets of values; they are used to restrict the scope of variables,
      control the formation of expressions, and classify expressions by their values.

    A ‘type’ is a string of symbols defined inductively by the following formation rules.
    The first two being being for the base types of ‘individuals’ and Booleans, while the third being
    an infinite hierarchy of ‘function’ types.

  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
𝒯 ::= ι | 𝔹 | (𝒯 → 𝒯)
#+END_SRC

  Semantically, a function type denotes a domain of /total functions/:
  $⟦α → β⟧ = ⟦α⟧ → ⟦β⟧$.

  A /language/ is a pair $L = (C, τ)$ consisting of a set of /constant symbols/ $C$
  which are assigned types by the total function $τ : C → 𝒯$; i.e., a ‘signature’
  of primitive symbols used to construct expressions of the language.

  /Expressions E of type α of a language L/ are strings of symbols defined inductively by the following formation rules.
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
e  ::=  (𝓋 : α)    -- annotation of variable
      | e e       -- application
      | (λ 𝓋 • e) -- abstraction
      | 𝒸         -- constant symbol
      | e = e     -- equality
      | (I 𝓋 • e) -- definite description
#+END_SRC
Of course not all combinations of symbols are meaningful.
A string of symbols ~e~ is considered an expression only if it can be assigned a type; i.e.,
we can find some ~γ ∈ 𝒯~ so that ~e : γ~ according to the following rules.
That is “_:_” is an inductively defined binary predicate; which is determinstic in its second argument.
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
0. e = (x : α)       ⇒  e : α
1. f : α → β, e : α  ⇒  f e : β
2. e : β             ⇒  (λ x : α • e) : α → β
3. c ∈ C             ⇒  c : τ(c)
4. e : α, d : α      ⇒  (e = d) : 𝔹
5. p : 𝔹             ⇒  (I x : α • p) : α
#+END_SRC

  Write $ℰ \, α$ for the collection of expressions of type $α$.

 + Abstraction defines functions from expressions mentioning variables.
 + Definite description builds an expression that denotes the unique value that satisfies a given property.

   $(I x : α • p)$ denotes the unique value $x$ of type $α$ satisfying $p$, if it exists and is a
   canonical “error” value of type $α$ otherwise.

 + Annotation constructs a variable by assingin a type to a member of 𝓋, an infinite set of symbols.

 - Different kinds of expressions are distinuisghed /by type/ instead of /by form/.
 - Within the body of a qunatification over variable $x : α$, we will write just $x$ rather than $(x : α)$.

 The syntax of STT with types in addition to expressions is a bit more complex than the syntax of first-order logic.
 However, the syntax is also more uniform than the syntax of first-order logic since
 /expressions serve as both terms and formulae/ and /constant include individual constants, function symbols, and predicate/
 /symbols as well as constants of many other types./ There are *no propositional or predicate connectives* in STT,
 but we will see later that these can be easily defined in STT using function application, abstraction, and equality.

* The semantics of STT is based on a small collection of well-established ideas

  A /standard model/ for a language $L$ is a triple $𝓜 = (⟦-⟧₀, ⟦-⟧₁, err)$ where
  1. $⟦-⟧₀ : 𝒯 → 𝒮ℯ𝓉$ assigns each type a non-emppty set.
     - $⟦𝔹⟧₀$ is the Booleans.
     - $⟦α → β⟧₀ = ⟦α⟧₀ → ⟦β⟧₀$ are the total functions between the interpreted sets.
  2. $⟦-⟧₁ : (c : C) → ⟦τ c⟧₁$ assigns each constant symbol
     to a value in the interpreation of the symbol's type.
  3. $err : (α : 𝒯) → ⟦α⟧₀$ is a function associating each type with a ‘error’ value.

  The subscripts of ~⟦-⟧ᵢ~ will generally be omitted.

  + ⟦ι⟧ corresponds to the ‘universe of discourse’ in a first-order model.
  + Note that the function domains of a standard model are determined by the choice of ⟦ι⟧ alone.

  # nice

  1. A /variable assignment/ into ℳ is a variable-to-value assignment $σ : ∀ α • 𝓋 → ⟦α⟧$.
  2. One then defines the /valuation/ function $⟦-⟧₂ = ⟦-⟧_σ : ∀ α • ℰ α → ⟦α⟧$ that takes expressions to values as follows:
     1. $⟦(x : α)⟧₂ = σ(x)$
     2. $⟦c⟧₂ = ⟦c⟧₁$ for $c ∈ C$
     3. $⟦f e⟧₂ = ⟦f⟧₂ ⟦e⟧₂$, for function application.
     4. $⟦ λ x : α • e⟧₂$, for $e : β$, is the function $f : ⟦α⟧ → ⟦β⟧$ such that, for
        each $a ∈ ⟦α⟧$, we have $f(a) = ⟦e⟧₂′$ where $⟦-⟧₂′$ uses $σ[(x : α) ↦ a]$ instead of $σ$.

        The semantics of function abstraction is defined using the same trick, due to Tarski, that is
        used to define the semantics for universal quantification in first-order logic.
     5. $⟦e = d⟧₂$ is ~true~ if $⟦e⟧₂ = ⟦d⟧₂$ and ~false~ otherwise.
     6. $⟦I x : α • p⟧₂$ is the unique $a ∈ ⟦α⟧₀$ with $⟦p⟧′₂ = true$ if it exists, and is
        $err_α$ otherwise.

  Some jargon:
  1. A value $a ∈ ⟦α⟧$ is /nameable/ if it is the value of some closed expression ~e~; i.e., $⟦e⟧₂ = a$.
  2. /A is valid in 𝓜/, written $M ⊨ A$, if $⟦A⟧_σ = true$ for all variable assignment $σ$ into 𝓜.
  3. /A is a semantic consequence/ of a set Σ of sentences, written $Σ ⊨ A$, if for every model ℳ,
     whenever $ℳ ⊨ B$ for all $B ∈ Σ$ then $ℳ ⊨ A$.
  4. A /theory/ $T = (L, Γ)$ is a language $L$ along with a set of sentences $Γ$, called /the axioms of T./
     - Semantic conseqence for theories: $T ⊨ A$ means $Γ ⊨ A$.
     - A /standard model for theory T/ is a standard model ℳ for $L$ such that $M ⊨ B$ for all $B ∈ Γ$.

  # nice

  The two semantics of first-order logic and STT are based on essentially the same ideas: Domains of discourse,
  truth values, and functions; models for languages; variable assignments; and valuation functions defined
  recursively on the syntax of expressions.

* STT is a highly expressive (classical) logic

  Even though STT is formulated as a ‘function theory’, it is a form of higher-order predicate logic.
  Indeed its higher-order quantification lets us define the following connectives.

  | Operation   | Definition                                                                    |
  |-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | ~true~        | $(λ x : 𝔹 • x) = (λ x : 𝔹 • x)$                                               |
  | ~false~       | $(λ x : 𝔹 • true) = (λ x : 𝔹 • x)$                                            |
  | ~p ∧ q~       | $(λ f : 𝔹 → (𝔹 → 𝔹) • f \; true \; true) = (λ f : 𝔹 → (𝔹 → 𝔹) • f \; p \; q)$ |
  | ~∀ x : α • p~ | $(λ x : α • p) = (λ x : α • true)$                                            |
  | $⊥_α$       | $I x : α • x ≠ x$                                                             |

  Where the remaining connectives are obtained by duality:
  $¬ p ≡ (p = false)$, $p ∨ q ≡ ¬(¬ p ∧ ¬ q)$, $(∃ x : α • p) = ¬ (∀ x : α • ¬ p)$,
  and $p ≠ q ≡ ¬(p = q)$.

  Since STT is equipped with full higher-order quantification and definite description,
  most mathematical notions can be directly and naturally expressed in STT.
  None of the following examples can be directly expressed in first-order logic.
  1. Function composition is expressed by $λ f : ι → ι • λ g : ι → ι • λ x : ι • f (g\, x)$.
  2. Inverse image is expressed by $λ f : ι → ι • λ s : ι → 𝔹 • I s′ : ι → 𝔹 • ∀ x : ι • s′ \,x = s\, (f\, x)$.

  | ⟪Its simple semantics makes STT suitable for general purpose logic.⟫ |

  Theoretically speaking the inclusion of definite description adds no additional expressivitiy,
  however from a practicaly stand-point it makes it easy to actually express ideas.
  See Russell's “On Denoting”. The removal of definite description does simplify the semantics
  since error values would no longer be needed. However, without definite description it would
  not be possible to directly express the many mathematical concepts that are defined in informal
  mathematics using the phrasing “the $x$ that satisfies $P$” such as the notion of the limit
  of a function.

* STT admits categorical theories of infinite structures

  A theory is /categorical/ if it has exactly one model up to isomorphism.
  - These are useful for when we want to capture eseentially the only model
    we're interested in; in a clean minimal fashion.
  - E.g., completely ordered fields are categorical ---the real numbers.
  - E.g., any algebraic data type is categorical, that's why we can code safely in
    functional programming.
    * ADTs are initial and so unique up to unique isomorphism.
  - E.g., Peano Arithmetic is categorical ---the natural numbers.

 The theory PA, of Peano Arithmetic, has constants ~0, s~ with ~τ = 0 ↦ ι, s ↦ ι → ι~
  and axioms that zero is not a successor, ~s~ is injective, and the induction principle (IP)
  which may be rendered as the STT expression
  | $∀ p : ι → 𝔹 • (p\,0 \;∧\; (∀ x : ι • p\,x ⇒ p\,(s\, x))) ⇒ ∀ x : ι • p\, x$ |

  PA *cannot* be directly formalised in first-order logic because the induction principle
  involves quantification over predicates, which is not directly expressible in first-order
  logic. Instead, in FOL one resorts to an infinite collection of formulaes called the
  /induction schema/:
  #+begin_quote org
  As axiom take each sentence that is a universal closure of a formula of the form
  | (B[0] ∧ (∀ x • B[x] ⇒ B[s\, x])) ⇒ ∀ x • B[x]|
  where ~B[x]~ is a formula.
  #+end_quote
  This approximates the IP since it includes just a countable number
  of instances of IP ---one for each equivalence class of formulas related by logical
  equivalence--- while IP has a continuum number of instances ---one for each property of the
  natural numbers. Consequently, such a formulation of PA is not categorical since it
  does not contain all instances of IP. As such, it has “nonstandard” models containing
  infinite natural numbers by the compactness theorem of FOL.

    #+latex: \vspace{1em}
  /By the compactness theorem of FOL, any first-order theory that has an infinite
  model has infinitely many (infinite) nonisomorphic models!/
  Whence, lack of categoricity is a fundamental weakness of FOL:
  A first-order theory that is inteded to specifiy a single infinite structure cannot be
  categorical.

* STT has a simple, elegant, and powerful proof system

  + A /proof system/ 𝑷 consists of a finite set of axiom schemas and rules of inference.
  + A /proof/ of a formula $A$ from theory $T = (L, Γ)$ in 𝑷 is a finite sequence of formulas
    of $L$ where $A$ is the last member of the sequence and every member of the sequence is an
    instance of one of the axiom schemas of 𝑷, a member of Γ, or is inferred from previous
    members by a rule of inference of 𝑷.
  + Let $T ⊢_𝑷 A$ mean there is a proof of $A$ from $T$ in 𝑷.
  + If for every theory $T$ and formula $A$, if $T ⊢_𝑷 A \;⇒\; T ⊨ A$ then say 𝑷 is /sound/.
  + If for every theory $T$ and formula $A$, if $T ⊢_𝑷 A \;⇐\; T ⊨ A$ then say 𝑷 is /complete./

  By Godel's Incompleteness Theorem,
  STT has no sound & complete proof system, which is a sign of its strength.

  #+latex: \vspace{1em}
  STT has simple proof system consisting of the following 6 axiom schemas
  and a single rule of inference. ( They are schemas since the type variables ‘α’
  cannot be quantified. )
  + A1 :: Truth Values;
          $∀ f : 𝔹 → 𝔹 • (f \,\mathsf{true} \,∧\, f\,\mathsf{false})
           \,=\, (∀ x : 𝔹 • f\, x)$.
  + A2 :: Leibniz' Law;
          $∀ x, y : α • x = y ⇒ ∀ p : α → 𝔹 • p\,x = p\,y$
  + A3 :: Extensionality;
          $∀ f, g : (α → β) • (f = g) = (∀ x : α • f\,x = g\, x)$
  + A4 :: Beta-Reduction;
          $(λ x : α • e) \, d \;=\; e[x ≔ d]$

          ( λ-abstraction acts as the converse rule. )
  + A5 :: Definite Description Introduction;
          $(∃₁ x : α • p) ⇒ p[x ≔ (I x : α • p)]$ where ∃₁ is the usual unique-existence.
  + A6 :: Definite Description Elimination:
          $¬(∃₁ x : α • p) ⇒ (I x : α • p) = ⊥_α$
  + R1 :: Equality Substitution:
         From $L = R$ and $E$ infer the result of replacing one occurence of $L$ in $E$
         by an occurence of $R$, provided that the occurrence of $L$ in $E$ is not
         a variable immediately preceded by λ or I.

  #+latex: \vspace{1em}
  Even though its necessairly incomplete, as mentioned earlier,
  the following system is sound since each instance of the schemas can be shown to be valid
  in any standard model and the rule preserves validity.

  #+latex: \vspace{1em}
  Does this system have sufficient provability power to be useful?
  Yes! Why? By experience, including the number of proof assistants based on this system
  such as HOL and Isabelle.

  # Adding an axiom that says the domain of individuals is infinite allows us to
  # encode PA and prove IP.
